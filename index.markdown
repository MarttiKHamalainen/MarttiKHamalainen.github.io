Hello, I'm studying programming and I publish work related to my studies on this site. 

I made a little card game. A functionality of the game is made by myself. A card deck has copied and modified from Youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxRwIZWjLtE&t=935s" [available 14.12.2022].
  
How to play the game? Select your card by clicking on it and computer choose it's own card. Card with higher value win. Start the game from the link below.
