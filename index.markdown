I'm studying programming and I made a little card game. I made the functionality of the game myself. The card deck is copied and modified from Youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxRwIZWjLtE&t=935s" [available 14.12.2022].
  
How to play the game? Select your card by clicking on it and computer choose it's own card. Card with higher value win. Start the game from the link below.
